we  used java polymorphic  to create a child factory 
transfer the child method to run the child method;
it can not use other extra method because the child factory or child object implements the father

it taste safy?


Factory factory=new ChildFactory();

AObject aObject =factory . CreateA ();

aObject.amethod();
